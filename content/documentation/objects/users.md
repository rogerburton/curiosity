# Users

## Base user (Completion-0)

The "base" user is the initial state of the user object. To create it, the
system requires:

- a username
- a password
- an email address
- an acceptance of our TOS (using a mandatory checkbox)

The email address is necessary because it is used by the password reset process
(which involves sending a non-guessable URL be email).

Most features of the system are available to users "upgraded" from the "base"
status.

When sufficient additional information are filled by the user, additional
services are available (e.g. registering to a training session or using

## Questions

- The Completion levels are mostly about using Smart services. But what about
  clients, or advisors ?
- When a social share is bought, is "member" another Completion level ?
- We don't talk yet about a public profile.
